# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    Proud of how I haven't had to reference my notes as often! Very excited to see how naturally code is starting to come.
    I do think I still don't quite have a grasp on how to call out my own method and using already installed commands.
    I.E. I thought if I did something like this that it would work
        def greet_person.capitalize(first,middle,last)
         puts "#{first} #{middle} #{last}"
            end
        greet_person("Anthea","Chian","Yur")

        Using .capitalize and incorporating it into this code doesn't seem to work for me. Could use a little brush up and assistance/examples I think!
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    Methods are great in the way that we can call them easily and also customize our needs.
